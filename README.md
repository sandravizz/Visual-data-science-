# Visual data science

Explorative data visualisation is a very important part when analyising the structure in our data. It should always be one of the first steps when starting a new *data science* project. Please check the corresponding [presentation](https://slides.com/sandraviz/rggplot2/embed?style=light) as well as corresponding [video tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL53pYdoYDFiv2PFCiuXR53PZj9bZrZpyp)

### Introduction 

In this chapter I introduce the concept of the R visualisation package *ggplot*, regarding the installation please check the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Installations). Afterwards it is the next step to define a *theme* please check the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/visual-data-science-R/blob/main/Themes.R) 

### Distributions 

In this chapter we look at different visualisation type to show distribution of variables. In the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Distributions) you find the logical flow. 

Chart types covered

- Frequency plot 
- Histogram 
- Box-plot
- Density plot

### Relationships 

In this chapter we look at different visualisation type to show relationships between 2 variables. In the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Explorative%20analysis) you find the logical flow. 

Chart types covered

- Scatter plot 
- Beeswarm plot 
- Hexagonal binning

### Time series 

Time series data have a very specific structure. Generally we want to check different variables by the time variable, which makes the space of possible visualisation types smaller. It is a good start to look at the overall evolution and then zoom in to specific categories which can be outliers discovered beforehand. Please check the corresponding [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/visual-data-science-R/blob/main/Time%20series.R) 

### Advanced visualisations 

In this chapter I present three more advanced chart type as their strucutre is less commonly used and/or cover higer visual complexity. Pleased check the code](https://github.com/sandravizz/visual-data-science-R/blob/main/Advanced%20visualisations.R) 

Chart types covered

- Parallel coordinates
