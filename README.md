# Visual data science

Explorative data visualisation is a very important part when analyising the structure in our data. It should always be one of the first steps when starting a new *data science* project. Please find the corresponding [Presentation](https://slides.com/sandraviz/rggplot2/embed?style=light).

### Introduction 

In this chapter I introduce the concept of ggplot, regarding [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Installations)
you are asked to install the necessary libraries. 

### Distributions 

In this chapter we look at different visualisation type to show distribution of variables. In the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Distributions) you find the logical flow. 

### Relationships 

In this chapter we look at different visualisation type to show relationships between variables. In the [code](https://github.com/sandravizz/Visual-data-science-R/blob/main/R-%20Explorative%20analysis) you find the logical flow.
